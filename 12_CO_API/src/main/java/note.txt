Benefit Issuance:
----------------------

-> Benefit Issuance module is responsible to send benefit amount to citizens who got approved for the plan.
-> Benefit amount  will be sent to citizen on monthly basis.
-> Sending benefit amount is batch Process with Monthly Schedule.

------------------------
BI Module Business Logic
------------------------

->BI Module should read all Approved Citizens and it should create one file(CSV) with citizens data
  i.e Case Number, Name, SSN, BenefitAmt, Account Number, Bank Name
  
  Like This:
	123345, John, 87787878, 350.00$, 55564564, HDFC
	122345, smith, 87785578, 250.00$, 55564564, syndicate
  		
  
-> BI module should keep the CSV file in FTP location (Remote Location)

NOTE: Bank Application will load CSV file from FTP location and it will perform Transactions.
